# Introduction to Version Control with Git

Come learn about Git! Git is a version control system widely used in software engineering, academia, and anywhere where projects need reliable and granular versioning – especially when the projects need to scale to thousands of contributors. 

In this tutorial, you’ll learn the basics of working with Git repositories, how to sync your local repository to GitHub, and more!
